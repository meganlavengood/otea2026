## Highlights

In general my student evaluations are strong, and nearly always stronger than the School of Music average. I analyzed the difference between my scores and those of the School of Music. I found that I consistently score higher than my department/college average

I highlighted a few rows of data that are particularly important to me and reflect my teaching philosophy. resonates with my own perception of my strengths and how I spend my time preparing for teaching. I place utmost importance on organization and clarity in my written materials and it's clear that is working well for the students.

## Critique of Student Evaluations as a Tool

What do student evaluations of teaching signify? GMU's Faculty Senate wrote in [a letter dated February 7, 2022](https://oiep.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SET-Faculty-Senate-Letter-Feb-2022.pdf) that "there is no evidence that our current SET process has improved teaching and learning, and equally important, the existing form reinforces biases, especially against women and people of color." Similarly, in 2019, The American Sociological Association (ASA) wrote a "[Statement on Student Evaluations of Teaching](https://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/asa_statement_on_student_evaluations_of_teaching_feb132020.pdf)," which explains that "a scholarly consensus has emerged that using SETs as the primary measure of teaching effectiveness in faculty review processes can systematically disadvantage faculty from marginalized groups." They specifically discuss how non-male and/or non-white professors perform worse on course evaluations: "students rate women instructors lower than they rate men, even when they exhibit the same teaching behaviors," and "Black and Asian faculty members are evaluated less positively than White faculty … especially by students who are White men." I am unable to assess whether this applies in my own case, but I ask that any reviewers please consider this both in my own tenure case and with those of other faculty who may belong to one or more of these marginalized groups.

Aside from identity, the ASA identifies other factors outside the instructor's control that influence their evaluations:

> Despite the ubiquity of SETs, a growing body of evidence suggests that their use in personnel decisions is problematic. SETs are weakly related to other measures of teaching effectiveness and student learning (Boring, Ottoboni, and Stark 2016; Uttl, White, and Gonzalez 2017); they are used in statistically problematic ways (e.g., categorical measures are treated as interval, response rates are ignored, small differences are given undue weight, and distributions are not reported) (Boysen 2015; Stark and Freishtat 2014); and they can be influenced by course characteristics like time of day, subject, class size, and whether the course is required, all of which are unrelated to teaching effectiveness.

In the past, when I looked at my own data, I see correlations with the issues presented in the quoted passage above.

- **Response rates:** As I have shown in one of my charts, the response rates for my evaluations vary significantly, and lower response rates at times correlated to lower ratings.
- **Distributions of ratings:** These are not reported in course evaluations prior to Fall 2020, when Mason switched to Blue for evaluation reporting.
- **Class size:** MUSI 215 in Fall 2019 recieved my lowest ratings for teaching, and are also the second- and third-largest classes I've ever taught in my entire teaching career (35 and 32 students in each section).
- **Meeting time:** Low ratings Question #16 (overall rating for the course) appear much more frequently in my 9:00 AM courses.

I have presented my course evaluations in my portfolio in the interest of transparency and to conform to the expectations of the university and the academy more broadly, but I feel I would be remiss not to contextualize student evaluations in this way. [The ASA statement](https://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/asa_statement_on_student_evaluations_of_teaching_feb132020.pdf) provides a bibliography and additional resources for those curious to know more about these issues.

## Closing statement

I am continuing to develop my online teaching as a I move forward in my career. The revisions for _OMT2_ with VIVA are ongoing. I have applied to do a Stearns Center Course ReDesign Academy to move a graduate remedial course to an online, asynchronous module that provides individualized learning paths for students based on their results on a placement test. And I will continue to oversee and mentor instructors in teaching online.

I admittedly did not have the time I wish I had to put together my portfolio. I ask the committee to kindly note that CVPA is the only college that requires its tenured faculty to teach a 3/3 on top of maintaining an active research profile. While my portfolio here could have included much more detail, it is my hope that my materials to some extent can speak for themselves. I believe I'm a compelling online instructor and a generous colleague and mentor to other online instructors. I thank the committee for this opportunity to share my work.
