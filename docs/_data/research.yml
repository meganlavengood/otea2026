  alt: "A screenshot of a post on the music theory subreddit with the title 'What makes a song sound Arabic?' The text of the question reads: I recently played Arabian Dances by Brian Balmages and it made me wonder what gave it that feel as far as notes. I guess I'm looking for something like a scale that could be used as a general framework. Edit: thanks to the people who knew what I was talking about and answered my question. I probably should have mentioned I am a saxophone player and I want to try and use a lot of this theory to improv and just to hear the different directions I can take while playing. I'm not going to try and write a piece that doesn't do their culture justice. I just want to know about some of the theory, most of which I'm interested in is in the piece I asked about, which I understand is largely a western interpretation. But scales that originated in that culture that can be loosely applied to our 12 tone system are great too, because I can still use those to some extent."
