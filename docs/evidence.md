In 2018, I put together a team that won a $30,000 from the Virtual Library of Virginia (VIVA) to substantially expand and revise the open educational resource _Open Music Theory (OMT)_. In its [first incarnation](https://openmusictheory.github.io), OMT was unusually broad in its offerings (including galant schemata, popular music, and atonal theory), but the instructional text was minimal, and there was no workbook. Supported by our grant funds, in [_OMT_ version 2](https://openmusictheory.github.io) _(OMT2)_, my coauthors and I drastically expanded the content of each chapter, authored many new ones, and created a workbook to accompany nearly every chapter in the text. I authored most of the Jazz section of the textbook, many of the Popular Music chapters, and other selected chapters (especially in 20th- and 21st-Century Techniques). I also used my skills as a web designer to create a style guide for authors and to style our website with CSS.

All our content is illustrated through music notation examples with interactive playback, interactive H5P content, video, audio, and image. Assignments are all available as both PDFs and editable formats (e.g., DOCX). And of course the book is also accessible and responsive for phones and other devices. Traditional music theory core textbooks can cost $200 or more, so _OMT2_ as a free resource saves substantial money for students.

_OMT2_ officially launched in July 2021. _OMT2_ is of course the adopted text at each of the seven institutions at which the authors teach, and we have an additional 80 schools that have self-reported their adoption of the text. Over 700 instructors have requested access to answer keys and other supplemental material. Analytics were implemented in November 2021; since then, we’ve had 2,469,673 unique visitors and 4,896,543 pageviews.

VIVA has said we are, by a wide margin, the most popular book published by VIVA, and as a result, reached out to us to have _OMT2_ be a pilot case for their upcoming New Editions Program—effectively, awarding us a second grant without us applying for one. Because of its huge readership, they are motivated to make the book look as good as possible because of its wide reach, and are providing us with editing and typesetting as well as administrative coordination, all at no cost to the authors. The work for creating this new addition will continue throughout this next semester and summer. Given all of this, we expect worldwide use of _OMT2_ to continue growing.

### Materials on Music and Multimedia

I also developed [online course materials for Theory for 20th/21st-c. Music (MUSI 216)](https://musi216.meganlavengood.com), mainly focused on music and media (e.g., film music, video game music). Pages include videos, interactive music players, audio, and images.

## Community Building

- [Padlet for sharing final projects in Theory for Pop and Jazz Music](https://musi215.meganlavengood.com). Students completely optionally shared their final projects and commented on each others' projects.
- Teams channels dedicated to socialization (Introductions, Off-Topic) encourage students to post [friendly](/assets/teams-ss1.png) and [personal](/assets/teams-ss2.png) content unprompted.

This final project is representative of what I typically do for my graduate seminars. Note the following:

- Clear organization
- Prominent due dates
- Fully scaffolded project with repeated and thorough feedback
- Rubrics for each phase
- Anchor links for easier perusal of the project
- Structured peer review among students
- Flexible deadline
- Extra helpful tips in addition to project requirements
