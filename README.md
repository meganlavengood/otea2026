## ideas list

-   scrollspy TOC for blog posts—currently bugged in BS and may be fixed in a future update
-   experiment with fully dx7-based color palette
-   implement dark mode toggle
-   optimize for print (CV page at least)
-   retire presentations.meganlavengood.com and move content over here
-   fold research.yml into cv.yml somehow
